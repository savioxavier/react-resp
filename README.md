# react-resp

> **Dynamically build responsive layouts in React**

`react-resp` is a React library that provides a set of utility components to dynamically build responsive layouts

## üõ†Ô∏è Install

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```text
npm i react-resp
```

## üîó Usage

react-resp exports multiple components. These components have the name of the viewports they bind to, named `<[Viewport]>`, as well their inverse, named `<Not[Viewport]>`.

One such component is called `<Mobile>`, and it's inverse is `<NotMobile>`

Below are some examples to get you started:

**Strict Viewports only**

Using the syntax below, you can dynamically render specific components/elements for a given viewport, based on current viewport specified

```jsx
import { Mobile, Tablet, Laptop } from 'react-resp'

const Navbar = () => {
  <nav className="navbar">
      <div className="navbar-description">
      <p>
          <Mobile>Mobile: Short Description</Mobile>
          <Tablet>
          Tablet: Slightly longer description visible on a tablet screen
          </Tablet>
          <Laptop>
          Laptop: A very long description on the navbar and has a lot of words
          </Laptop>
      </p>
      </div>
  </nav>
}
```

**Strict and Exceptional "Not" Viewports**

By using a combination of `<[Viewport]>` and `<Not[Viewport]>`, you can dynamically render specific components on a single viewport of your choice, and render something else on all other viewport except the one you've already targeted

```jsx
import { Mobile, Tablet, Laptop } from 'react-resp'

const Navbar = () => {
  <nav className="navbar">
    <div className="navbar-description">
      <Mobile>Mobile: Short Description</Mobile>
      <NotMobile>
        Tablet and Laptop: A description that is displayed on all viewports except mobile
      </NotMobile>
    </div>
  </nav>
}
```
